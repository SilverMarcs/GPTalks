# Contributing to _VisualEffectView_

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to _VisualEffectView_ on GitHub.

> Above all, thank you for your interest in the project and for taking the time to contribute! üëç

## Asking Questions

We don't use GitHub as a support forum.
For any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself,
please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead.
By doing so, you'll be more likely to quickly solve your problem,
and you'll allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer.
This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.

## Reporting Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

Before submitting a new GitHub issue, please make sure to

- Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/efremidze/VisualEffectView).
- Read the usage guide on [the README](https://github.com/efremidze/VisualEffectView/#usage).
- Search for [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/efremidze/VisualEffectView/issues).

If the above doesn't help, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/efremidze/VisualEffectView/issues) on GitHub.

## I want to contribute to _VisualEffectView_

### Prerequisites

To develop _VisualEffectView_, you will need to use an Xcode version compatible with the Swift version specified in the [README](https://github.com/efremidze/VisualEffectView/#requirements).

### Checking out the repository

- Clone your fork:
    - `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/VisualEffectView.git`
- Create a new branch to work on:
    - `git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>`
    - A good name for a branch describes the thing you‚Äôll be working on, e.g. `voice-over`, `fix-font-size`, etc.

That‚Äôs it! Now you‚Äôre ready to work on _VisualEffectView_. Open the `VisualEffectView.xcworkspace` workspace to start coding.

### Things to keep in mind

- Please do not change the minimum iOS version
- Always document new public methods and properties

### Testing your local changes

Before opening a pull request, please make sure your changes don't break things.

- The framework and example project should build without warnings
- The example project should run without issues.

### Submitting the PR

When the coding is done and you‚Äôve finished testing your changes, you are ready to submit the PR to the [main repo](https://github.com/efremidze/VisualEffectView). Some best practices are:
